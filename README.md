App for greek grammer

I'am studying theology and have taken Greek and Hebrew language courses. Last
year when I took Hebrew I made an companion app, for [Hebrew grammar](https://github.com/ArnstadFredrik/Hebrew), which i
grew very fond of, but I never made one for Greek, which i took the year before.
So now I'm converting the Hebrew grammar app, over to Greek, so I have both
grammar companions.
